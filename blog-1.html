            </h2>
            <p>
                The CSS box model is a container that contains multiple properties including borders, margin, padding,
                and the content itself. It is used to create the design and layout of web pages. It can be used as a
                toolkit for customizing the layout of different elements. The web browser renders every element as a
                rectangular box according to the CSS box model. Box-Model has multiple properties in CSS. Some of them
                are given below:

                content: This property is used to displays the text, images, etc, that can be sized using the width &
                height property.
                padding: This property is used to create space around the element, inside any defined border.
                border: This property is used to cover the content & any padding, & also allows to set the style, color,
                and width of the border.
                margin: This property is used to create space around the element ie., around the border area.
                The following figure illustrates the Box model in CSS.

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Content Area: This area consists of content like text, images, or other media content. It is
                        bounded by the content edge and its dimensions are given by content-box width and height.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Padding Area: It includes the element's padding. This area is actually the space around the
                        content area and within the border-box. Its dimensions are given by the width of the padding-box
                        and the height of the padding-box.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Border Area: It is the area between the box's padding and margin. Its dimensions are given by
                        the width and height of the border.
                    </li>
                    <li>

                        Margin Area: This area consists of space between border and margin. The dimensions of the Margin
                        area are the margin-box width and the margin-box height. It is useful to separate the element
                        from its neighbors.
